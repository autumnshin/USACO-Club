**Which language?** <!--sub-->

The most popular language for USACO work is likely C++. This tutorial begins with Java as that is the language most beginners know best. Once you get a hang of USACO, you are more than welcome to learn C++, even encouraged. However, never fear if you decide to stick with Java. All of the USACO problems can be successfully written in either language.

**Environment Setup** <!--sub-->

You can follow these steps to set up your environment. The video below will walk you through the process.

1. Clone [this repo.][https://github.com/ATCS-BCA/USACOHelp.github.io]
2. Open USACO_Intro in your favorite IDE. Our demo uses VSCode. More VSCode instructions are listed below.
3. Run section1/section1_1/test.java. It should produce a new file test.out. If it does, your environment is set up!

**VSCode** <!--sub-->
One of the challenges of USACO is that they do not use packages. Organization of folders in Eclipse and IntelliJ often involves packages. In VSCode, new folders do not necessarily mean new packages.

After installing VSCode, you may wish to install the following extensions:

* Java Extension Pack
* Code Runner
* Java Code Generators

**Getting Setup** <!--sub sub-->
1. Open the Folder USACO_Intro
2. Go to File -> Save Workspace As -- choose a name of your preference for saving the workspace.

**Running Programs** <!--sub sub-->
In our setup the input data files are commingled in the source directories. This helps in organization. However, to run the Java programs, you will need to navigate to the source directory.

1. Launch the terminal.
2. Change directories to *section1/section1_1*
3. Run javac *.java to compile source in this directory.
4. Run *java test* to execute test.


Finally, after you are all set up, it's time to start solving problems! Register at [usaco.org], the USACO website which holds contests and has past contests for you to practice, and at [train.usaco.org], which presents problems in increasing difficulty. The following video walks you through getting setup and prepares you to solve your first programming challenge.
Good luck!
